# SoundJS

SoundJS is a library to make working with audio on the web easier. It provides a consistent API for playing audio in
different browsers, including using a target plugin model to provide an easy way to provide additional audio plugins
like a Flash fallback. A mechanism has been provided for easily tying in audio preloading to
[PreloadJS](http://createjs.com/preloadjs/).
